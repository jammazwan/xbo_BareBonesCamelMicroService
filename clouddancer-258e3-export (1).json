      "answer" : "Two early immigrants, Kazimierz Pułaski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, led armies in the Revolutionary War and are remembered as national heroes. Overall, more than one million Poles and Polish subjects have immigrated to the United States, primarily during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Exact immigration numbers are unknown. Many immigrants were classified as \"Russian\", \"German\", and \"Austrian\" by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service because the Polish state did not exist from 1795 to 1918, and thus the former territories of Poland at this time were under Prussian, Austrian-Hungarian and Russian control. Complicating the U.S. Census figures further are the high proportion of Polish Americans who marry outside their ethnicity; in 1940, about 50 percent married other American ethnics, and a study in 1988 found that 54 percent of Polish Americans three generations or higher had been of mixed ancestry. The Polish American Cultural Center places a figure of Americans who have some Polish ancestry at 19-20 million.\n\n",

Hence the many approaches found within the Nu Skin community, and of course, the factions that grow around these different approaches.\n\nThe cloudDancer community itself grew out of a different approach, and we can tell you that it is neither good nor bad, but it IS about each of us, and who we are.\n\nANY approach that works for you is the right approach. This community is here to support you no matter which approach, and no matter what kind of person you feel that you are.\n\n\"Integrity\" has many different definitions and usages. The operative concept here is the integrity that comes about when a person's actions and needs are roughly congruent with each other. If you are tugged one way and aiming the other, you may feel yourself out of integrity. \n\nWe're here to help you aim in any direction you prefer. But we also support you as you are anchored in your own history and development as a person. Growth is about movement from where you are. And, so are we.",

When on other product lines, I want to see first we see if there’s absorption, then we see what else is contained in the ingredient list of constituents that are being absorbed and hands down, our older LifePak Nano is the king of the hill.  But we also have the regular Lifepak for the budget conscious, vitality for more epigenetic influence into the body in the mitochondria, meaning energy, mental clarity, more productive and restful sleep etc.  And then the g3 juice for super low scores, perhaps poor absorption and those who hate taking ‘too many capsules”.\n\nWe already had a wonderful line-up.  Then we have the new science of AgeLOC Youth and it’s raising the bar even higher and we know it’s resetting that gene expression.  Let me know how much science you guys would like to see and I’ll send along.  Meanwhile. I shall give you a holler and let’s see what we should do for your order…. please know I’m here to serve your needs and really truly do want to see a human that improves and not just an order.
